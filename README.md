# .dotfiles

This repository contains my dotfiles which I use to configure my system.

## Usage

To use these dotfiles, make sure that you have `stow` installed on your system. Then it's as simple as cloning this repository and running the `stow .` command.

```bash
cd ~/workspace
git clone git@github.com:aadimator/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
stow . --adopt
```
